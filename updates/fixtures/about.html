<br />
One other thing: Earlier today, Borgen briefly offered Borgen Bucks for sale, but intentionally did not include an additional Borgen Buck with the purchase. This decision was made to emphasize Borgen's character as a greedy individual, but unfortunately, the joke did not resonate well with many players. We apologize for any confusion or disappointment this may have caused. As a team, we acknowledge that mistakes can happen during the design and content creation process, and we have taken this as a learning opportunity to improve our approach in the future.<br />

SMALL BUT DEFINITELY REAL UPDATES:<br />
- There are 3 new chat commands to try:<br />
<i>/buddy</i> will give you realtime information on what Buddy is up to<br />
<i>/ric</i> will summon Ric Ryph for assistance<br />
<i>/skillz</i> will show your Skillz Level progress<br />
- Farm RPG is now sponsored by Pepperidge Farms. Look for opportunities to buy your favorite summer sausage brands, soon!<br />
- Removed the option to use Large Nets. We felt that using regular fishing nets gave a stronger sense of pride and accomplishment.<br />
- New skillz have been implemented. Experience the joy of Duck Calling, Painting, Lawn Care, Ship-mastering, Running, Hiding, Dancing, Ninjutsu, Swimming, Fencing, Whittling, Thieving, Improvisation, Bow Hunting, Chewing, Jumping, Archery and Welding, all from your browser! Each mini-game will test your strength, patience, and/or will to endure! <br />
- Ric Ryph has a new Help Request chain involving time travel and gold expenditure. This thrilling story will take you through various timelines to experience Farm RPG as Firestream intended before the quest-writers mucked it all up. <br />
- Lag Increase: The game has felt too responsive and as a result, we are adding a 1-second delay to all actions, to better emulate previous Farm RPG experiences.<br />
