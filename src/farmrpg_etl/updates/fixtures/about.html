- If you have trouble, be sure to check that you have the latest update for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/farm-rpg/id1564601242" class="external close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a><br />

HOUSE OF CARDS IN BETA<br />
- IN BETA: There is a new location in Town called the House of Cards<br />
- IN BETA: To access, you'll need to acquire the Rune Dice from a new questline that is unlocked once you get Buddy Friendship to level 50<br />
- IN BETA: The House of Cards has two parts: Daily Card Combos and Buddyjack<br />
- IN BETA: Daily Card Combos --> Each day you will be presented with a combination of cards you can play to earn a reward. The cards are played and turned in when you do this. The rewards are pretty good, including some things found nowhere else in the game. You have the current day to play the combo or not, and a new combo will appear at reset.<br />
- IN BETA: Buddyjack --> A game you can play in the House of Cards daily. Buddyjack is like 21, but simpler. For each game, the dealer (Buddy) has a score and you need to beat his score without going over 21. You can 'hit me' or 'stay' to play. If you win, you get a random card (Clubs, Hearts, Spades, Diamonds or Joker). If you get a 21 and win, you get an extra card reward. If you tie the dealer, you get a consolation prize<br />
- IN BETA: You can play Buddyjack 3 times per day. Perks will be added to increase the amount of times you can play daily, but these are still being planned and are not available yet.<br />
- IN BETA: The beta chat is available for a time again. Just refresh or fully restart your game<br />
- Staff will be working on library pages to document the House of Cards and how it works<br />
- More information on <a href="wiki.php?page=Beta Testing" class="no-animation close-panel" style="color:crimson; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Beta Testing</a><br />
<br />
SMALL UPDATES:<br />
- New craftable item <a href="item.php?id=776" class="close-panel"><img src='/img/items/shipinabottle.png?3' alt="Ship in a Bottle" class='itemimgsm'></a><span style="display:none">Ship in a Bottle</span><br />
<br />
OTHER NOTES:<br />
- The questline to get Rune Dice is actually available to all players (once you meet the quest requirements)<br />
- If you complete it and get the Rune Dice item, you will just have to sit on it until the House of Cards is out of Beta<br />

<br />
One other thing: Earlier today, Borgen briefly offered Borgen Bucks for sale, but intentionally did not include an additional Borgen Buck with the purchase. This decision was made to emphasize Borgen's character as a greedy individual, but unfortunately, the joke did not resonate well with many players. We apologize for any confusion or disappointment this may have caused. As a team, we acknowledge that mistakes can happen during the design and content creation process, and we have taken this as a learning opportunity to improve our approach in the future.<br />

Each mini-game will test your strength, patience, and/or will to endure! <br />
- Ric Ryph has a new Help Request chain involving time travel and gold expenditure. This thrilling story will take you through various timelines to experience Farm RPG as Firestream intended before the quest-writers mucked it all up. <br />

- Two new craftable items: <a href="item.php?id=712" class="close-panel"><img src='/img/items/pboot.png' alt="Polished Boot" class='itemimgsm'></a><span style="display:none">Polished Boot</span> and <a href="item.php?id=713" class="close-panel"><img src='/img/items/pboot2.png' alt="Pair of Boots" class='itemimgsm'></a><span style="display:none">Pair of Boots</span><br />
- <a href="item.php?id=467" class="close-panel"><img src='/img/items/gboot.png?1' alt="Gold Boot" class='itemimgsm'></a><span style="display:none">Gold Boot</span> has new icon art<br />
- Carved Rabbit is now possible to get from the Wishing Well<br />
- Fixed a bug in PHRs where they could ask for more than a player's inventory cap<br />
- Pet Shop prices are now shortened to fit better on mobile devices </div>

MERCY SYSTEM IN BETA<br />
- IN BETA: The Temple of Reward, the new mercy system, is in Town for <a href="wiki.php?page=Beta Testing" class="no-animation close-panel" style="color:crimson; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Beta Testing</a><br />
- IN BETA: The system works like this, if you sacrifice a particular item enough, you'll be rewarded with a very rare item and along the way some smaller rewards. This gives you a guaranteed path to get certain items you need to progress through the game.<br />
- IN BETA: You can, of course, still get the rare items like you always have, but the <a href="temple.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Temple</a> is more of a guarantee if you choose to go down that path<br />
- IN BETA: Once the temple is live, it will require Farming 40 to access in Town<br />
- IN BETA: The temple was designed to take items as you obtain them so that inventory cap really isn't a factor. You still have to bring the items to the temple, in batches. <br />
- IN BETA: You can reset a temple sacrificial reward chain, but you can only do that once per day. Each time you reset a reward chain, the amount that you need to sacrifice increases as well.<br />
- IN BETA: To start with, there are 3 sacrificial chains available. More will be added in time. However, we are not putting every single rare item in the temple, just the ones that seem to be the most important towards game progression.<br />
- IN BETA: In time, it is possible that new rare items will be obtainable only via the Temple of Reward as well. More info if and when that happens. We are planning to add some achievements and a merit badge via the temple also.<br />
- IN BETA: Refresh the game to see the 'beta' chat channel again to talk about the temple. </div>

FROZEN CROP DROP RATE FIX<br />
- The drop rate for "frozen" crops was set to a LOWER amount than intended when you don't have the runecube effect active. This value has been fixed for the 3 crops now and should only be about 20% less often than with the runecube perk active (which is intended).<br />
- In addition, there are some one-time trades for frozen crops in the <a href="exchange.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Exchange Center</a> to get you back on track if you were affected by this issue.<br />

2022 YEAR END WRAP-UP<br />
It's been a great 2022 at Farm RPG! We've seen a lot of growth and updates this year, along with some ups and downs, but overall it's been a fantastic year.<br />
<br />
The December Event went very smoothly and we hope you enjoyed it. Over 16,000 people logged in during the event and participated. December ended up being one of the best, if not the best, month for activity for the year as well. Events are a pretty major part of the game and we will continue to work on events throughout the year and keep the game exciting and fun. Thank you to everybody that came out and participated.<br />
<br />
Here's a quick rundown of everything that was added to the game in 2022: Wheel of Borgen, Merit Badges, New Fishing Bait: Mealworms, Apple Cider Repurpose, The Vault, Daily Chores, Referral System, Lag Reduction and Speed fixes, QoL Features, Large Nets, Arnold Palmers, Valentine's Day Event, St Patricks Day Mini-Event, Workshop Item Order, New Servers, Egg Hunt Event, The Tower, Android IAPs, Birthday Event, Art Gallery, Exchange Center, Lv 80 Fishing Zone, Steelworks, Auto-refreshing Mailboxes (Beta), XP to Silver Conversion, Personal Help Requests, Skill Level Rewards, Level 80 Exploring Zone, Schoolhouse, Back-to-School Event, Raptor Fight Club, Craftworks, Friendship Levels, Friendship Rewards, Cooking Skill, Library Favorites (Beta), Buddy's Adventure, October Event, Jill's Corn Maze, Redbrook Adventures, Thanksgiving Mini-Event, December Event, Large Nets X10, Comet's Adventure, Condensed Farm View (Beta), Lv 90 Fishing Zone and a ton of little updates, fixes and changes. Whew.<br />
<br />
We are excited for 2023 and have a lot of ideas and planned updates in work. As the <a href="roadmap.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Roadmap</a> shows there's a lot of content coming and some improvements to existing systems such as cooking and meals. We have a large player base that uses accessibility tools, such as voiceover, and we'd like to improve the game for those players (including manual fishing). We've got a lot of endgame players itching for new content and challenging goals and we'd like to deliver on that. We've got more townsfolk stories to tell and places and people to discover. We also hope to bring out some Farm RPG merchandise (shirts, stickers, etc) as well.<br />
<br />
If you are reading this, thank you for playing and being a part of the game and excellent community we have. We hope you will continue playing and invite your friends and family. We are really excited to continue updates in 2023 to make the game even better. </div>

THANKSGIVING MINI-EVENT:<br />
- November 24 through November 27 enjoy +10% more Skill XP, +10% more Silver at Market and Meals can still be used during the event<br />
- Last year's Thanksgiving Help Requests will be available for new players and there will be a few new Thanksgiving Help Requests as well<br />
- Black Friday Gold bonus of +20% on Gold Purchases on Nov 25 and Nov 26 (2 days only!)<br />
- Regarding 200k lack-of-event: We hit 200k registered much earlier than expected! Because of this, the timing of doing a big 200k event doesn't work out with Thanksgiving and Christmas events being planned and setup. Rosalie Help Requests went up yesterday to give out some nice items for the game reaching this milestone. Thanks for understanding.<br />
- One other note: A few of last year's Thanksgiving Help Requests gave out a bunch of cornucopia items (many of you have them still from last year). The item was changed for this year's starter pack to include Gold, so because of that, the cornucopia items are no longer part of last year's Thanksgiving Help Requests.<br />

This is the first time Beta status has been included in an IAP and not via Patreon. This is a great way to give it a try this month to see if you would like to continue supporting the game via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/farmrpg" class="external close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patreon</a><br />

- The Deck The Town series of Special Help Requests have been turned off (Except I-III)<br />
- The series will be re-enabled in chunks (3-5 at a time) starting tomorrow sometime<br />
- We are doing the best we can getting a handle on the lag due to the new quests. Thank you for your patience and understanding<br />
<br />
LAG LAG LAG AND SMALL UPDATES:<br />
- First off, yep, its laggy, and very slow and frustrating to everybody. We dropped 20 grindy quests on the world this morning and everybody and their mama is trying to complete them at the same time.<br />
- The good news is the lag has pinpointed a major thing that can be improved before the next big event, so we've got that going for us at least.<br />
- The lag will die off in time as more and more people complete the grind. You've got tons of time, so if you don't feel like dealing with lag today, we understand.<br />
- Added a new Heart Container item <a href="item.php?id=671" class="close-panel"><img src='/img/items/heartcontainer.png?1' alt="Heart Container" class='itemimgsm'></a><span style="display:none">Heart Container</span> that is crafted from 4 Pieces of Heart. The Townsfolk really love this.<br />
- Added some new icons by the Explore actions and increased their tapping height a little bit<br />
- You can click on the IOTD now </div>

- Check Home and must be Farming 30 to play!<br />
- Do a full refresh/reload of the game to see a Corn Maze chat channel if you want to discuss the maze, but you might find it more fun to explore on your own and not get spoiled.<br />
- You may find it helpful to draw a map as you explore the maze as there's a lot of twists and turns to keep straight<br />

- A new town location has been added: Redbrook Adventures<br />
- The Corn Maze and Buddy's Adventure (now out of Beta) will be available via Redbrook Adventures as permanent additions<br />

BUDDY'S ADVENTURE IN BETA:<br />

- IN BETA: In reality, this is the 'Advanced Exploration System' in the <a href="roadmap.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Roadmap</a> and has a lot of power to allow our team to create branching stories with different paths and endings, good and bad. Endings can give nice item rewards as well, which you'll see in Buddy's Adventure<br />
- IN BETA: Beta Testers, see if you can get every good and bad ending <br />

COOKING IS LIVE TO ALL PLAYERS!<br />
- I'm really happy to announce the Cooking Skill is available to all players (requires Farming 75 and Crafting 75)<br />
- To get started Cooking, go to your Farmhouse and add a Kitchen<br />
- Once you have a Kitchen, it is available on Home and you will start with a single oven and recipe<br />
- Cooking requires learning recipes and a lot of ingredients and resources. Currently there are 10 recipes (with more in work). Each of these can be learned by building your Friendship levels with the Townsfolk (Friendship Rewards is also out of beta, more on that in a second)<br />
- Once you have what you need to cook a meal, you can start it in an oven and some actions will become available while the meal is cooking. You can finish a cooking meal instantly if you want by drinking a Fruit Punch<br />
- Along with this there are Skill Rewards for Cooking up to Cooking 40 (with more coming as the system evolves)<br />
- There's an achievement for adding the Kitchen<br />
- New Skill Perks for Cooking as well as <a href="supply.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Farm Supply</a> Perks to add some nice 'All' buttons, but not required!<br />
- Once you add the Kitchen, you might start getting Daily Chores related to Cooking<br />
- The Cooking System is planned to expand greatly as time goes on, with more meals+recipes and a lot more neat concepts. This is only the beginning!<br />
- IMPORTANT: Please refresh/restart the game if you have any problems as a lot of new code is live to all<br />
- There's more info in the Library on <a href="wiki.php?page=Cooking" class="no-animation close-panel" style="color:crimson; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Cooking</a> as well<br />
<br />
FRIENDSHIP REWARDS LIVE TO ALL PLAYERS<br />
- You earn Friendship XP as you complete Help Requests and give the townsfolk items they like or love<br />
- Now in the Friendship Levels section rewards will appear as you level them up. Most Townsfolk have rewards up to Level 30 or 40 (with more in work)<br />
- This is the main way currently to learn recipes for Cooking<br />
SMALL UPDATES<br />

COOKING IN BETA - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY<br />
- There's a lot to talk about with this update. It is the first new skill added to the game since the beginning and it's really exciting that it is finally here in Beta!<br />
- IN BETA: To start cooking, you must be Farming 75 and Crafting 75. You will add the Kitchen by going to your Farmhouse<br />
- IN BETA: Once you have a Kitchen, you can access it from Home. You will have a single oven and you will know the recipe for Bone Broth to get you started<br />
- IN BETA: Most recipes will require Cooking Pots, so you will need to craft those. They require ingredients from Ember Lagoon, so you'll need to have access to that location as well<br />
- IN BETA: To start with, there are 8 recipes you can get. There will be many many more recipes as this develops. Of the 8 that are in the game today, 7 of them are learned by building your Friendship Levels with Townsfolk<br />
- IN BETA: Check Friendship Levels and you will now see Rewards that are unlocked as you build your levels. For now, all Townsfolk have rewards at 10,20 and 30 and a few past that. More Rewards will be added over time.<br />
- IN BETA: As you level up your Cooking Skill, you will be able to add more Ovens to make more meals at once<br />
- IN BETA: As you are cooking a meal, you can optionally Stir, Taste and Season the meal and each does something different.<br />
- IN BETA: Fruit Punch is a new drink you can craft. You can drink a Fruit Punch to instantly complete a meal that is cooking<br />
- IN BETA: There are new Skill Perks and <a href="supply.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Farm Supply</a> Perks to help you in Cooking and more will be added<br />
- IN BETA: There are Cooking Skill level rewards up to Cooking 30<br />
- IN BETA: You can also now increase the number of Meal Effects you can have active at once. This is done at the <a href="supply.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Farm Supply</a> and costs and increasing amount of Gold. You will start with 2.<br />
- IN BETA: There is a new 'beta' chat channel you can see if you are a Beta Tester. Be sure to do a full refresh/restart of your game<br />
- IN BETA: This system is evolving every day, please expect changes! You might see recipes change, level requirements change, costs change and so on. Nothing is perfect Day 1, so please understand if something changes unexpectedly.<br />
<br />
- ONE MORE NOTE: The goal is to have this out of Beta no later than the 2nd week of October, if not sooner! However, this is a very big update and will leave Beta when it is ready to leave Beta. For more information on becoming a Beta Tester, check out the Farm RPG <a href="https://www.patreon.com/farmrpg" class="external close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patreon</a><br />
FRIENDSHIP LEVELS AVAILABLE<br />
- The Friendship System is available to all players<br />
- On Home, Look for Friendship Levels and you will see each Townsfolk and your Friendship Level with them<br />
- You earn Friendship XP by completing Help Requests and giving them item in their Mailbox<br />
- As you discover items they like or love, they will appear at the top of their Mailbox<br />
<br />
A NOTE ABOUT MEAL EFFECTS<br />
- Meal Effects can be very powerful and are almost like mini-events that you control. Because of the power of these items, Meals will not be able to be used during Game Events, when there is a global bonus on for all players. So, because of this, feel free to use your Meals as there is no need to hoard them. </div>

THE GREAT COOKING SKILL UPDATE<br />
- Mark your calendars, the Cooking Skill Update will enter Beta on Monday 9/26!<br />
- This is a substantial update that adds a brand new Skill to the game for the first time since Farm RPG started<br />
- When it enters Beta more details will be shared, but there's a substantial amount of content in this update with even more to come during Beta. It has been a long time in the making and I'm very excited to have it nearly ready.<br />
<br />
SMALL UPDATES<br />
- IN BETA: When you complete a Help Request you will get Friendship XP for the Townsfolk you assisted.<br />
- IN BETA: Previously completed Help Request will retroactively give Friendship XP. To trigger this visit Help Needed and then check your Friendship Levels. If you have fairly high levels in Friendships, it may be hard to tell an increase, but be assured you got XP for previously completed Help Requests.<br />
- IN BETA: Rosalie can correctly accept dyes in her Mailbox now<br />
- Note for non-Beta: Friendship XP is actually accruing even if you don't have access to the Friendship Levels section. This includes any XP you gained from completing Help Requests. When this leaves Beta you will see your progress. </div>

- IMPORTANT: The use of Cider, Lemonade, AP is not possible in this zone until you finish a questline that is still being finalized.<br />

You will have to find the components, complete help requests and ultimately create a device to keep it away from you. This series of quests will come out in the next week or so. Until then, tread lightly.<br />
- You can work on crafting Machine Presses and Corn Oil with components found in Jundland<br />
<br />
SKILL LEVEL REWARDS - IN BETA<br />
- IN BETA: There is a new Skill Level Reward system where you earn nice rewards for leveling up your Skills<br />
- IN BETA: Skill Rewards unlock every 10 levels and 99 in each Skill. Currently there are a total of 40 sets of rewards, all of which meant to help you in progressing through your Skills<br />
- IN BETA: In addition, when you reach 99 in a Skill you also get 100 Ascension Knowledge as part of the rewards<br />
- IN BETA: If you are already 99 in a Skill, don't worry, because you can retroactively collect the Skill Level Rewards<br />
<br />
CRAFTWORKS AVAILABLE TO ALL PLAYERS NOW<br />
- Items added to the Craftworks will be crafted automatically anytime the resources are available in the order you set<br />
- Each item slot requires Gold to unlock, with an increasing cost. This is a massive Quality of Life system and very powerful once you understand how to use it properly<br />
- Requires Crafting Level 30 to add to your Workshop<br />
- TIP: Items default to paused when you add them, so don't forget to hit Play to start the crafting<br />
- For more information, check out <a href="wiki.php?page=craftworks" class="no-animation close-panel" style="color:crimson; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">craftworks</a> in the Library<br />
<br />
NEW PET: RED FOX<br />
- There's a new Pet at the Pet Shop, the Red Fox<br />
- This little guy will bring some nice items to you hourly. He was put together by WhatTheFox, so send her some fish today too!<br />
<br />
CRAFTING RESOURCE SAVER LOGIC CHANGES<br />
- In an effort to get Craftworks and manual Crafting working with resource saver perks, I've been working with Coderanger to reduce the exponential effect of the resource saver perks.<br />
- The change is in the crafting system now. With that, the % bonus of the resource saver perks have been increased: RS1 10%, RS2 15% and RS3 20% for a total of +45% in crafting<br />
- The intent of this change is to balance out the perk effect for over max crafting so that you can craft under or over your inventory cap and still see a level effect of the perk.<br />
- Please send all your fish to Coderanger today for the help with this change!<br />
<br />
RAPTOR FIGHT CLUB (RFC) UPDATES:<br />
- New League system in place. Leagues are based on favorite Raptor treats.<br />
- Your Raptors are automatically placed in a League based on Overall Wins. Once in a League, you'll see a League Record / Rank as well as your overall Record / Rank<br />
- Adjusted some combat mechanics slightly, reducing how often gold feathers are used and tweaked some other stats<br />
- Remember, we don't talk about RFC.<br />

MORE TOWER LEVELS:<br />
- Tower Level 101 to 119 is now reachable!<br />
- This ties in a new 'Mega-Mastery' system that will continue to roll out in future updates<br />
- Tower Levels over 100 will require a certain amount of Mega-Masteries (MM), starting out fairly low and increasing as you climb higher. You don't consume MM, but rather you just need a certain number of them as you continue to climb the Tower.<br />
- The Artifact at 110 is obtainable, but has no effect yet. If you are wondering why, the effect is being held until the Cooking Skill is released. CHANGE OF PLANS: The Artifact unlocks Orchard Land VI at <a href="supply.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Farm Supply</a><br />
- The Artifact is also renamed to better follow the previous item pattern.<br />
- You can see Mega-Mastery counts on the Mastery Page and Profiles<br />

MY OTHER GAME TITAN CONQUEST:<br />
- In case you didn't know, I have another game, <a href="https://titanconquest.com" class="external close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Titan Conquest</a>, that is a bit older and I recently republished it for iOS and moved it over to a new season of Leaderboards.<br />
- <a href="https://titanconquest.com" class="external close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Titan Conquest</a> is a real grindy game, more than Farm RPG. Feel free to try it and maybe you'll like it!<br />
- <a href="https://titanconquest.com" class="external close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Titan Conquest</a> is available for iOS/Android/Web just like Farm RPG<br />
BACK TO SCHOOL EVENT PRE-HYPE<br />
- In early August there will be a 'Back to School Bash' Event!<br />
- Dates will be announced in another update soon. The event will focus on 'learning' with a lot of Crafting/Mastery/AK perks and some nice Special Help Requests. More details when we are closer to being ready! </div>

SMALL UPDATES:<br />
- Adjusted how Resource Saver Perks work some to counter T90 effect. Basically the return of resources when you craft over your max inventory has been reduced.<br />
- To clarify more, this wasn't really an exploit, but a side-effect of the higher Resource Saver available at T90 and just needed to be toned down some.<br />
- Fixed bug with Help Request Left count showing incorrect on Home </div>

MAX STAMINA CHANGE:<br />
- Max Stamina now has an added benefit. If your current stamina is at or over max, you basically don't get any stamina from the system automatically. To counter this, the amount of max stamina you have is added to your Farmhouse every 3 hours.<br />
- When you go and 'rest' once a day in your Farmhouse, you still get the increase in Max, but you also instantly get the stamina that has collected since the last time you rested.<br />
- Example: Max stamina is 500, so after 24 hours, there would be 4,000 stamina that would get added to your stamina when you rest.<br />

- Mega Beet Seeds are a new seed type. They take the same amount of time as the regular seed, but yield 10x of the crop they grow. So planting a single Mega Beet Seed will give you 10x Beets, etc<br />
- The <a href="exchange.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Exchange Center</a> has a trade offer in rotation to get Mega Beet Seeds<br />

PEACHES AND PEACH JUICE<br />
- Peaches can be obtained by completing Personal Help Requests (in Beta)<br />
- PS, this applies to new PHRs, so if you don't see the peach on your current request, complete them and new ones will have the peach included.<br />
- 10x Peaches (and glass bottle) can be used to make Peach Juice (which is masterable)<br />
- Peaches can also be given to other players<br />
- Peach Juice allows you to 'skip' a Personal Help Request (it makes you invisible to the Townsfolk making the request)<br />
- It is likely Peach Juice will have additional effects in the future<br />
<br />
SOME NOTES ON SKIPPING PERSONAL HELP REQUESTS<br />
Let's say you have 2 left that you just don't want to complete. Drink a Peach Juice for each and they will go away. The game will give you 3 more Personal Help Requests if it's been at least a day since the last 3 you got. Otherwise, you'll need to spend 10 Gold or wait for the next reset.<br />
<br />
SMALL UPDATES:<br />
- On item details, you can tap the item name now to copy the item shortcut link into your clipboard<br />
- This change requires a restart/refresh of the game.<br />
- Drink Apple Cider button stays visible now. If you don't have enough stamina to actually use one, it will do a regular explore<br />
- Fixed bug in <a href="exchange.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Exchange Center</a> preventing the Shark Tooth trade from appearing as often as it should<br />
- When tracking a quest and completing a different quest, the system will keep the quest you were tracking<br />
NOTES BOX IN ALPHA (LIVE GAME)<br />
- IN ALPHA: On the LIVE game, Alpha players will see a 'Notes Box' towards the bottom of Home<br />
- IN ALPHA: You can use this space to leave yourself notes, to assist in what you're doing in-game or whatever<br />
- IN ALPHA: There is no save button, you just type in the box and it will remember<br />
- IN ALPHA: This may remain an Alpha-only feature as part of the Live Game </div>

PERSONAL HELP REQUESTS IN BETA:<br />
- IN BETA: The new Personal Help Request system is in <a href="wiki.php?page=Beta Testing" class="no-animation close-panel" style="color:crimson; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Beta Testing</a><br />
- IN BETA: These Help Requests are generated by the system automatically based on many factors, including your Skill levels, inventory cap, item rarity and more.<br />
- IN BETA: You will see 3 of these generated under Help Needed. Once you complete all three, you can get 3 more at the next reset or spend Gold for 3 more instantly<br />
- IN BETA: This is a complicated system and while the system tries to be smart on what it asks for and what it rewards, there are probably some kinks in it. We are working during Beta to get all of this smoothed out, so thanks for your patience and understanding<br />
- There is a great Library page in work with more details on <a href="wiki.php?page=Personal Help Requests" class="no-animation close-panel" style="color:crimson; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Personal Help Requests</a> </div>

LAG ISSUES<br />
- The new fishing zone brought about a large spike in server load<br />
- This is mostly due to a lot of people trying to use all of their fishing nets / large nets all at once at the same time in the new zone<br />
- To help keep load down and the game playable for all players, the delay in using a fishing net has been restored so to reduce spamming of nets and ruining the game experience for all players<br />
- This is a temporary change probably and once the new zone has been reachable for some time fishing nets can go back to their normal speed of use<br />

- To make that even easier, less wait time, the <a href="exchange.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Exchange Center</a> will rotate offers 2 times per day now (midnight/noon game time)<br />

EXCHANGE CENTER NOW OPEN<br />
- The Exchange Center in Town is now out of Beta<br />
- The XP conversion portion is still closed and will go into Beta this week<br />
- A new Help Request series is out to get you on your way to the new Fishing Zone<br />
- The new Help Requests will require you to make trades at the Exchange Center. Keep in mind the Trade Offers change daily.<br />
- What? I can't reach the new zone today? That's correct... here's why: We put a ton of time / effort into planning and creating new zones, quests, etc with new items and new things to see. In the past we have launched big quest lines and people complete them in literal minutes. The game is a marathon, not a sprint, so the Exchange Center trade offers allow us to slow the pace and control how long it should take to reach somewhere new.<br />
- This is the first time the Exchange Center has been directly tied to Quest-lines though and is subject to change as we work out any kinks/balance issues. Thanks for understanding.<br />
<br />
SMALL UPDATES<br />
- <a href="wiki.php?page=Giamics' Jubilee" class="no-animation close-panel" style="color:crimson; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Giamics' Jubilee</a> Part XII - XIV come out tomorrow, 6/1<br />
- Help Requests can optionally require Tower Levels now. New Help Requests are in work that will require certain Tower Levels in the future. </div>

HOT POTATO EVENT BOOST<br />
- The event so far has been a neat social experiment, but the rate at which the boost has increased is not where I hoped/expected. So, I've bumped up the % per thousand to 3% per thousand people that get the Hot Potato<br />
- So as of now, we're at 7000+ so the Bonus is (7000 * 3) + 5 = 26%<br />
- Also, because the first 24 hours were very low compared to a typical event, I'm extending the Event Bonus through Monday Afternoon (5/16)<br />
- Hope you are enjoying it! </div>

150,000 REGISTERED PLAYERS!<br />
- We made it to 150k before the 1st Birthday of Farm RPG!<br />
- Thanks to everybody here playing, sharing and making Farm RPG a great community!<br />
<br />
BIRTHDAY EVENT STARTS THURSDAY!<br />
- The 1st Birthday Event starts Thursday 5/12 and will run through Sunday 5/15<br />
- There will be a nice Community Center on 5/12<br />
- There will be Special Help Requests<br />
- There will be nice 'Items of the Day' at Market each day of the Event<br />
- The Bonus to XP/Silver comes with a twist:<br />
<br />
HOT POTATO<br />
- A new item called the 'Hot Potato' will be given out each hour by the Townsfolk<br />
- Once you get this item, give it to another player quick!<br />
- The Bonus to XP and Silver is directly tied to the number of players that are able to get the Hot Potato item during the Event<br />
- The Bonus will start at 5% and could get as high as 40% (depending on the success of Hot Potato)<br />
<br />
MORE DETAILS ON HOW THIS WORKS<br />
- Base bonus to XP and Silver is 5%<br />
- For every 1,000 players that get the 'Hot Potato' item, the bonus will increase by 2%<br />
- Example, if 10,000 people participate and get the item the total bonus would be 25%, etc<br />
- If you have the item in your Inventory or Mailbox you will see a big message on Home telling you, so that you can give it to the next person ASAP<br />
- The Event bonus and progress will be visible on Home during the Event<br />
- Hot Potatoes won't get stuck because the Townsfolk will continue to give them out to people each hour.<br />
- If you get more than one you can continue to give them to people that haven't gotten one yet<br />
- After the event, the 'Hot Potato' will be sellable for 50,000 Silver each as well </div>

- Completing more chores for missed days will only work for the current month, meaning you couldn't keep doing it for months prior to the current month, etc.<br />
- One more thing: This only works for 'missed' days, so you would have had to complete previous days in the month for the 'Get more chores' to give you chores to complete a missed day. </div>

ITEM MASTERY TRACKER<br />
- New in <a href="supply.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Farm Supply</a>, you can activate the Mastery Tracker<br />
- This allows you to track up to 8 items at once in a panel at the bottom and easily see your Mastery progress<br />
- It also provides a handy button to go to your Item Mastery details<br />
- NOTE: Since this uses the same panel area as Help Request Tracking, you'll have to choose one or the other. So, if you are tracking a Help Request, you won't be able to track Mastery progress at the same time.<br />

THE TOWER IS AVAILABLE TO ALL PLAYERS NOW<br />
- The Tower is unlockable now for all players and is no longer in Beta<br />
- Currently, the top level in the tower is 100<br />
- There are Tower Artifacts unlocked every 10 levels in the Tower. IMPORTANT NOTE: The Artifacts at 80,90 and 100 are NOT complete yet. You can get the item, but they do not have an effect. This will be completed in the coming weeks.<br />
- Also, each Tower Level you unlock now grants you daily passive Silver income in the amount of 5,000,000 Silver per level per day. Example: Tower 30 would give you 150 million per day (happens at Reset)<br />
- There is a lot to take in here! Be sure to read the <a href="wiki.php?page=tower" class="no-animation close-panel" style="color:crimson; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">tower</a> section in the Library or ask in chat for help<br />

A WARNING TO BOTTERS<br />
- This morning serious lag was caused by 3 accounts running bots to explore and fish. This is strictly against the <a href="coc.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Code of Conduct</a> and will not be tolerated.<br />
- Botting causes extremely high server load (one botter ran 30,000 calls in less than a minute, for example) and ruins the game and experience for everybody<br />
- We are getting more serious about tracking and banning accounts that think its ok to bot the game. This is a warning, because if you are botting, you are likely going to have your account banned permanently.<br />
- We are trying to avoid having to add "human-checks" or captchas to the game, but the botting problem is only getting worse. </div>

THE TOWER IN BETA<br />
- IN BETA: There's a lot to tell here. Many players have been working for weeks and weeks on A Towering Investment, and I'm very happy to be able to open up the Tower today to Beta players<br />
- IN BETA: The <a href="wiki.php?page=Tower" class="no-animation close-panel" style="color:crimson; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Tower</a> can be unlocked once you have a level 99 in any Skill, but to get the Tower Key, you'll need to complete 'A Towering Investment', which is quite a grind<br />
- IN BETA: Once unlocked, the grind continues. Each Tower Level requires Silver + <a href="wiki.php?page=Ascension Knowledge" class="no-animation close-panel" style="color:crimson; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Ascension Knowledge</a> (AK) to unlock. Each level unlocked gives you some nice rewards. Every 10 levels has something special, an Artifact, which in turn unlocks a perk you will find useful<br />
- IN BETA: Rewards will show in red if you are close to your max inventory space. If you collected them, you would lose some of them due to lack of space<br />
- IN BETA: You have retroactively been given AK for your Masteries/Grand Masteries and have been earning AK behind-the-scenes since Daily Chores launched<br />
- IN BETA: Be sure to check the Library pages out for the <a href="wiki.php?page=Tower" class="no-animation close-panel" style="color:crimson; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Tower</a> and <a href="wiki.php?page=Ascension Knowledge" class="no-animation close-panel" style="color:crimson; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Ascension Knowledge</a> for more information on this system<br />
- IN BETA: The Tower is designed to get you playing all parts of Farm RPG to make progress and should provide a challenge for those trying to reach the top<br />
- IN BETA: Your Tower progress is visible on profiles as well<br />
- IN BETA: For Tower Levels 1-9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 there's a special Emblem you can select in Settings<br />
- IN BETA: In the future, there will be Help Requests that required Tower Levels to access/complete<br />
- IN BETA: In the future, there will be over 300 Tower Levels and 30+ Artifacts, but a lot of that has to be added after more game additions are done, like new skills for Cooking and Mining<br />
- If you're interested in Beta status, check out <a href="https://www.patreon.com/farmrpg" class="external close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patreon</a><br />
- ONE MORE THING: Please keep Tower related discussion in Spoilers only! </div>

TOWER UPDATE<br />
- The long-awaited Tower will be in Beta on Monday, April 4th. However, it is ready to go today. The reason it is not out today is that many people will sign up for Beta to access it today and would get charged today and again on April 1st. I don't like people being charged twice, so I'm holding off on the Beta of the Tower until after the 1st of the month.<br />
- The Tower will start with 50 levels and 5 artifacts (Each with their own perk)<br />
- More levels will be added before the Tower leaves Beta, planning for 100 levels with a total of 10 Artifacts sometime during April<br />

SMALL UPDATES:<br />
- If you have the 'Pet Whistle' <a href="supply.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Farm Supply</a> perk, you can set a minimum number of ready items now in <a href="settings.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Settings</a><br />
- The 'Pet Whistle' banner will only appear if your pets have at least that number of items ready to collect<br />
- 'Why is this an update?' - A lot of people like the Pet Whistle, but the banner being up at the top every hour can get annoying. So this setting lets you minimize how often you see the banner by setting a minimum. Personally, I love knowing I have pet items ready, but I only care when maybe 1000 or so are ready to be collected.<br />
- New tradeable Gold Items: 5, 10, 25 and 50 Gold. They are in the Flea Market and can be tradeable at different Farming Levels in mailboxes. </div>

STAFF CHANGES<br />
- First off, I'd like to announce TempleOfStones has been promoted to Ranger! He'll be able to support the community during the US night hours.<br />
- Second off, Coderanger has been added to staff as a Farm Hand! He's been extremely helpful with the community so far and brings a lot of valuable technical knowledge to staff.<br />
- Be sure to send them both lots of fish!<br />
<br />
LARGE NETS AVAILABLE<br />
- Large Nets are out of Beta now and can be used by any player. They are craftable at Crafting 92 and save a lot of clicks when fishing.<br />
- Large Nets are about a 25x click reduction over using regular fishing nets<br />
- With the existing <a href="supply.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Farm Supply</a> 'Reinforced Netting' perk Large Nets catch 400 fish per net (25 more than using 25 regular nets manually). Without the perk it is a 1-to-1 ratio.<br />
ARNOLD PALMERS NOW IN BETA<br />
- IN BETA: These are similar to Large Nets. You can craft Arnold Palmers now at Crafting 92<br />
- IN BETA: These allow you to bulk use Lemonade basically. When you explore, if you have APs, you will drink them instead, which is like using 20x Lemonades at once<br />
- IN BETA: Arnold Palmer will either try to get you 200 items or 500 items, depending if you have the Lemon Squeezer <a href="supply.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Farm Supply</a> perk.<br />
- IN BETA: Crafted from 1x Ice Tea and 20x Lemonade<br />

THE TOWER - FAQ<br />
- Yep, The Tower is showing up under Explore the Area!<br />
- I wanted to clear up a few things though because in the hype of it all some people are confused.<br />
- First, The Tower is NOT a regular Exploration zone. It works differently.<br />
- The Tower Key cannot be obtained yet, but a Help Request line is almost ready to make that possible.<br />
- You'll need to be in the low 90s to start working on the Tower Key Help Requests.<br />
- More details to come.... </div>

DAILY CHORES IN ALPHA<br />
- IN ALPHA: A new Daily Chores system is in ALPHA, but part of the live game<br />
- IN ALPHA: Complete Daily Chores to earn Ancient Coins, but fill up your Calendar to earn great monthly rewards also<br />
- IN ALPHA: Full write-up of this system here: <a href="#" class="chatlink">[LINK REMOVED]</a><br />
- IN ALPHA: There's a handy Library Page too -> <a href="wiki.php?page=Daily Chores" class="no-animation close-panel" style="color:crimson; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">Daily Chores</a><br />
- NOTE: I don't normally put up Alpha content in the live game, but in this case I needed to test-run the system for 2 or 3 days with real numbers<br />
THE VAULT IS LIVE TO ALL PLAYERS<br />
- Check Town > The Vault once you are Farming 30<br />
- You can try to guess the code daily for a Silver reward<br />
- You can spend AC to get a new Vault or just wait till the next day<br />
- <a href="supply.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Farm Supply</a> perk to add an extra try to each Vault<br />
- This works similarly to 'Wordle'<br />
<br />
SMALL FIXES<br />
- Working on lag fixes all over the game<br />
- Vault coloring tweaked to help with double numbers<br />
- Buttons above Farm Crops start disabled and will enable when everything has loaded now. This is very subtle, in an attempt to reduce lag<br />
- Chat optimizations to speed them up<br />
- Potential fix for 'select/translate' popups when fishing, esp with nets </div>

STAFF ANNOUNCEMENT - NEW FARM HANDS<br />
- Firestream and the staff team want to thank everyone for their participation and enthusiasm for the staff application process. We have an extremely passionate group of players and there were more applications than anyone expected. The team took the process very seriously and after looking through over 180 applications, we narrowed the field of applicants to a group of just under 30. From these applications, there were some clear frontrunners based on both applications and in-game interactions with staff.<br />
- Before announcing who our new farm hands are, the team wants to take a moment to thank every single applicant who took the time to fill out their applications, in both rounds 1 and 2, we are truly grateful for your passion and willingness to volunteer. If you weren’t selected, we want you to know how much we value you as a community member, and please apply again. Your passion, your responses, and your willingness to volunteer are valued and Farm RPG wouldn’t be the same without each and every one of you.<br />
- We are excited to announce that the following members have been selected as new farm hands: WhatTheFox, Nethylant, leafmeolone, and Saph.<br />
- Please take a moment to congratulate our new farm hands and send them some fish! Thank you again to the entire community of players, sincerely Staff and Firestream<br />
<br />
SMALL UPDATES:<br />
- The <a href="supply.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Farm Supply</a> perks for Plant All / Harvest All have been removed<br />
- Plant All / Harvest All are now on by default for all players, even if you are brand new!<br />
- If you purchased Plant All / Harvest All, the gold you spent has been automatically added back to your account<br />
- In extensive testing, it was found that not having Plant All / Harvest All was extremely discouraging to a new player and resulted in a large amount of them not playing the game very long. It was a tough decision to remove the perks, but in the end all players benefit from the change. </div>

STAFF SELECTION UPDATE<br />
- Quick update, we are done going through the applications and will be able to announce the new staff members very soon!<br />
- Hopefully this announcement will be made tomorrow evening (Game Time) so stay tuned!<br />
<br />
THE VAULT IN BETA<br />
- IN BETA: In Town, look for The Vault<br />
- IN BETA: Every day you can try to guess the code to open the Vault and win a good chunk of Silver. The code is different per player.<br />
- IN BETA: To guess the code pay attention to the number color: Blue means you guessed a correct digit in the correct position. Yellow means you guessed a correct digit in the wrong position. Code is 4-digit (0001-9999).<br />
- IN BETA: You can get more guesses for Ancient Coins and even get a New Vault for them.<br />
- IN BETA: You start with 4 guesses, but there's a <a href="supply.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Farm Supply</a> perk to up that to 5 guesses permanently<br />
- IN BETA: There is an Achievement for opening the vault successfully the first time<br />
<br />
SMALL UPDATES:<br />
- Farmer's Market UI updated<br />
- Bulk Sell options now in a row of their own. Height reduced a lot<br />
- Sell All Unlocked only has ONE confirmation #confirmgate<br />
- Unlock All moved to the very bottom<br />
- IN BETA: Drink Apple Cider moved up to be just under Eat an Apple<br />
- For NON-BETA: Perk Reset cost will now cap at 100 Gold<br />
- New Merit Badge: Raptor Trainer - for having 150 Raptors hatched<br />
<br />

MERIT BADGE CHANGE<br />
- OK so I was wrong. It ended up being a terrible idea to encourage stamina hoarding for the Energizer Bunny III merit badge, so I have changed this.<br />
- The new Merit Badge is now called 'I am the Great Explorer' and is now based on actual stamina use in exploring. Use 30 million stamina and you unlock it. Check out <a href="achievements.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Achievements</a><br />
- 'Energizer Bunny' remains if you want to bank 1 million stamina. EB2 has been disabled (only 1 player managed to get it)<br />
<br />
STAFF APPLICATIONS ROUND 2<br />
- Over 160 applicants have been narrowed down to 28!<br />
- If you are one of those 28, you will have received a message asking you to fill out a 2nd form with more questions.<br />
- Round 2 will allow the 28 applicants 2 more days to review and answer the questions and then we will continue the process of selecting between 3 and 5 new farm hands to join staff.<br />
- Thanks for your patience! We take this process very seriously because we feel that staff must be a solid team of people from different backgrounds all working together towards a common goal, so with that said, the need to review each candidate thoroughly is very important.<br />

STOREHOUSE UPGRADE IN BETA<br />
- IN BETA: You can now upgrade the Storehouse with Silver and increase the amount of max inventory you gain from working each day<br />
- IN BETA: If you have Beta, you can 'work' again today so that you can upgrade first (and get Forklift II) and try it out<br />
- IMPORTANT: I'm planning on a short Beta for this because this system is for the F2P folk, so thanks for your patience. More info at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/farmrpg" class="external close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patreon</a><br />
<br />
STOREHOUSE CHANGES FOR ALL USERS<br />
- As of now, the base daily increase for the Storehouse is +2<br />
- If you already worked today, fear not, because you can do it again as of now and get the <a href="supply.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Farm Supply</a> perks (optionally) to get up to +6 for today<br />
- Forklift will increase this by +2 and a 2nd Forklift perk has been added to <a href="supply.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Farm Supply</a><br />
INVENTORY MAX OVER TIME<br />
- This is some example data: You should be able to get to +12 or +14 after quite a bit of silver and the 2 supply perks. This means in a month's time you can increase your max inventory by 360 - 420. After six months: 2160 - 2520. So, this should alleviate the pain of increasing your inventory and keep matched with Orchard growth over time.<br />
<br />
SMALL UPDATES:<br />

GET READY FOR TUESDAY<br />
- The festivities for the December Event start on Tuesday, 12/14!<br />

DATABASE MAINTENANCE ON MONDAY 12/13<br />
- Tomorrow morning I'll be taking the game offline somewhere between 8-10am for about 45 minutes to do some pre-event database maintenance.<br />
- I'll do my best to keep the downtime minimal. It is likely during the downtime that your buildings that run every few minutes will be paused. The top of the hour jobs will also be skipped if the maintenance takes longer than expected.<br />
- Just a heads up! </div>

NEW WORKSHOP LIVE TO ALL PLAYERS<br />
- As I said I would do, the new Workshop UI was in Beta for the least amount of time as possible. It is now the default Workshop and open to all players!<br />
- Thank you to all Beta testers that tested the heck out of the new system! This has already shown a huge reduction in lag and server load.<br />

NEW FOR BETA TESTERS - SAVED PERK SETS<br />
- This is a new feature for Beta (and up) players and will remain exclusive to Beta players<br />
- You can now save the set of Perks you have unlocked as a set and quickly change between your saved sets.<br />
- This is very useful if you have certain perks you like to have active depending on what you are actively doing in the game. It is Beta only because Beta players are allowed free perk resets as a thank you for supporting the game. </div>

LAG LAG AND MORE LAG<br />
- First, Happy Thanksgiving! I'm going to try to not work tomorrow<br />
- I'm sorry for all the ups and downs all day long. A ton of people are participating in the event, and due to some issues, the lag is crazy high. I've been working all day long trying to figure it out, with almost no luck. I'm trying though.<br />
- Borgen will NOT be around tomorrow. I will fix it so he returns, but I'm just out of time for now.<br />

FIGHTING LAG<br />
- Made a number of changes to reduce server load and fight lag today<br />
- The use of the 'Enter' key is disabled for exploring and fishing now. Unfortunately, there's a lot of abuse here by those that insist on holding keys down to explore faster. That causes extremely high server load, and leads to the lag spikes we keep seeing so often. I'll continue to work to add ways to burn through stamina faster, but I have to ensure the game stays stable for all that would like to play it.<br />
BOOKSHELF UPDATE<br />
- I'm still on track to have the Bookshelf in Beta before the month is over. Two of the books are 'readable' on Alpha game, including the Book of Time which allows you to use 100 stamina per continue. It's a neat effect, and relates to the previous update in that you can get through your stamina reserves faster.<br />
- It is an extremely busy time of the year for everybody. We are working to have the Thanksgiving Event good to go, prep for December/Christmas, get Bookshelf into Beta, plan for Cooking and so much more. Be sure to give the staff some grace as well, because they are super busy helping all over also. Get ready for a fun month! </div>

- If you thin down your Workshop items list, crafting speed will actually increase as well.<br />
<br />
CHANGE TO THE FARM RPG CHAT SYSTEM<br />
- Today, we are making the tough decision to end the "custom" option on the built-in chat system here.<br />
- A number of reasons have lead to this change, but the main reason is that we are unable to moderate them effectively to ensure the content and activity follows the <a href="coc.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Code of Conduct</a> and that the game remains safe and non-toxic for all that play it.<br />
- To be a bit more clear here, there are illegal discussions taking place that should not be happening. This is not something that will be tolerated here, and has pushed us to make this change immediately.<br />
- There will be 3 chat channels that will all be moderated by our staff. If you need more flexibility, you are welcome to use <a href="https://discord.com/invite/2tGxMVUC28" class="external close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>.<br />
- This change will be effective by the end of the day today.<br />
- There will be further changes to the <a href="coc.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Code of Conduct</a> and <a href="wiki.php?page=faq" class="no-animation close-panel" style="color:crimson; font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline">faq</a> as the system is adjusted.<br />
- Thank you for your understanding and patience on this matter. We are not taking this decision lightly.<br />
<br />
UPDATE: NEW CHAT CHANNEL LAYOUT IS LIVE<br />
- There are 4 channels now: Help, Global, Trade and Spoilers<br />
- All of these are moderated and subject to the <a href="coc.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Code of Conduct</a><br />
- Spoilers is hidden until you reach Farming 40 and does not have the swear filter and caps are allowed.<br />
- We will be making more changes to the <a href="coc.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Code of Conduct</a> as a result of these updates.<br />

RAPTORS HAVE INVADED FARM RPG<br />
- Earlier tonight, I dropped a new item on Whispering Creek --> <a href="item.php?id=394" class="close-panel"><img src='/img/items/raptoregg.png' alt="Raptor Egg" class='itemimgsm'></a><span style="display:none">Raptor Egg</span><br />
- This extremely rare item, once found, allows you to add the Raptor Pen to your farm<br />
- Raptor eggs then have to incubate for a few days before they hatch into a full blown Raptor. The animal lover perk applies here also.<br />
- Raptors will hunt daily and bring you Antlers and Steak Kabobs once a day<br />
- Incubate/Pet All Raptors come free with the Raptor Pen, there is no Farm Supply Upgrade here<br />
- This system is live for all players. It didn't go into Beta as I wanted it to be a surprise and for the most part I think the surprise went well and was well received.<br />
- Spared no expense! </div>

SMALL UPDATES<br />
- Fixed a cause for jumping when you craft: before when you would go into an item details, then back, and then craft the item, you would be jumped to the top. This should no longer happen.<br />

CRAFTING EFFECTIVENESS - NOW IN BETA<br />
- IN BETA: On Mastered items that can be crafted, you can visit the item details and buy Crafting Effectiveness with Silver<br />
- IN BETA: This allows you to craft 2x, 3x, 4x, etc of that item at once when you manually craft the item.<br />
- IN BETA: Crafting effectiveness is a permanent upgrade per item, meaning you will always craft extra of the item, so you have to take that into consideration for the resources you need. However, this system can reduce the amount of clicking to craft items drastically, so the trade-off is well worth it after Alpha feedback.<br />
- IN BETA: Crafting perks still apply, included resource saver (which actually becomes more effective the higher your multiplier goes)<br />
- IN BETA: We'll have a library page setup soon with more details.<br />
<br />
<br />
CRAFTING LEVEL 80 ITEM - FANCY GUITAR<br />
- At Crafting 80, you can now make the Fancy Guitar <a href="item.php?id=393" class="close-panel"><img src='/img/items/3857.png?1' alt="Fancy Guitar" class='itemimgsm'></a><span style="display:none">Fancy Guitar</span><br />
- It has a very good profit margin with a lot of XP also<br />
- Requires Oak from Whispering Creek and another new item, Steel Wire<br />
- Both Fancy Guitar and Steel Wire can be mastered<br />
UPDATE TO THIS!<br />
- After immediate feedback, the recipe for Steel Wire has been modified to not require steel (and glass orbs) so as to compliment your efforts to make Lanterns<br />
ANOTHER CRAFT ITEM + MASTERY<br />
- You can now craft Unpolished Shimmer Stone from Sandstone + Emberstone<br />
- Unpolished Shimmer Stone can also be mastered </div>

A TRIBUTE TO POSEIDON<br />
We lost a member of our community last month, @Poseidon, to some sort of accident. His family reached out to let me know of this tragic news.<br />
<br />
For those of you that knew Poseidon, he was a fantastic community member, staff member and all around great person. He joined in the very early days of the game's existence and was all-in from the start. He quickly became a staff member and assisted new players and veterans all over the game. He made some excellent infographics for drop rates and maintained the Library in other ways too. He was awesome, and he will be greatly missed.<br />
<br />
Today, there are some new Help Requests that are permanently part of the game. They are setup to require Poseidon's levels to access them and have a bit of challenge to them and an awesome Super Rare item as the final reward, the Trident of Poseidon. Special thanks to Tenfoo for his effort to come up with these Help Requests. </div>

GAME DOWNTIME AND RECOVERY<br />
- Hey all! So, you have probably noticed the game acting strange since about midnight last night and then it has been offline since about 7am game time. I'm going to try to breakdown what happened and what I'm doing about it.<br />
FIRST, WHAT HAPPENED<br />
- The game stopped allowing new items to be given to players just before midnight game time last night. At first, I thought the database table for items had crashed, but that wasn't the case. Here's the technical answer: There's an auto-incrementing unique ID per item per player. That type (MySQL INT) actually reached the max INT value of 2,147,483,647 so no new rows were being inserted into the table.<br />
- At first, I thought I would just change the type to BIGINT and keep going, but why did it hit 2.1 billion? We don't have that many players or items, so it shouldn't have happened. Turns out it was in 'how' I was adding items to the table. I have a unique constraint on the table for user + item, so inserts were happening even if the item was already in the table (which I thought was ok). With InnoDB the behavior by default is to keep incrementing the auto-incrementing value even if the insert didn't actually happen. It was a bad combination of things and ultimately something I never considered could or would happen. I've changed how I'm adding to the table and redone the keys to be INT with correct values.<br />
BACK ONLINE WITH A BACKUP OF THE DATABASE FROM JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT<br />
- Everything went really haywire since the items table couldn't accept new items. Hundreds, if not thousands of people, were getting items from playing and not actually getting the items in their Inventory. This affected every single part of the game from farming to the wishing well, pets, etc, everything. I had hundreds of support tickets from players that didn't get their items from quests, crafting, etc, so I had to make the hard decision of reverting to the backup from last night.<br />
- This means if you played from about Midnight to 7am game time, your progress is lost. I hate that so much, I really do, but the game was a complete wreck due to the items not being added correctly. I had a lot of complete activity where no rewards were actually given, etc, and it is a giant train-wreck.<br />
WHAT I'M DOING ABOUT ALL OF THIS<br />
- I've already fixed the table and the code and the ID column. Staff has tested things out and all feels ok again. I'm going to put up an "I'm really sorry" Help Request and give everybody some nice stuff today to make up for it, even if you weren't affected by this you'll be rewarded. I hate that it happened, and even though I try to mitigate this kind of thing from happening, it can happen still. So, I'm sorry once again.<br />
- If you bought Gold overnight I'll make sure you have that Gold still.<br />
- So... that's it. Thanks for reading and understanding and I hope that everybody can pick up from where we left off and continue enjoying the game and community.<br />
SPECIAL HELP REQUEST AND XP BONUS EXTENDED<br />
- Check for the 'Take this' special help request<br />
+20% Skill XP extended through Tuesday evening now<br />
ONE LAST THING<br />
- I realize that during the night some players found runestones or super rare items, and with rolling back to the previous backup, you no longer have that item. Send in a <a href="support.php" class="close-panel no-animation" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Support</a> ticket and I'll make it right for you. Allow me 24-48 hours to get through them all ;) </div>

MEDIUM UPDATES<br />
- You can open multiple things at once at the Locksmith now. There's a quantity box by each item that can be opened. For things that require keys, you can only open as many as you have keys for.<br />
- Make sure you read the notice at the top of the Locksmith and keep an eye on your inventory capacity!<br />
- I listed this as medium because it was a very complicated update to make, but it isn't that exciting :)<br />
<br />
SMALL UPDATES<br />

SMALL UPDATES<br />
- Ok, so a major source of lag has been identified and fixed! It had to do with item drops in the haunted house and the alerts you could get for so many of those items.<br />
- Many items will start locked, but far fewer of them actually alert you now (just rare stuff and Runestones)<br />
- Treat Bag 02 <a href="item.php?id=364" class="close-panel"><img src='/img/items/bag_t_03.png' alt="Treat Bag 02" class='itemimgsm'></a><span style="display:none">Treat Bag 02</span> has been adjusted slightly, but can now be given to other players! Now through 11/3<br />

NEW FISHING UI<br />
- The long awaited revamp of the fishing UI is out for all players!<br />
- The main change is that fish caught and net results appear at the top over the water and do not require any interaction. You can use fishing nets very fast now<br />
- NOTE: The "Yes I'm Sure" <a href="supply.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Farm Supply</a> perk is required to make use of quicker fishing net use.<br />
- The UI looks better in dark mode as well now<br />
- Please note there are probably some kinks in it still due to the number of devices, phones, tablets, laptops, and connections speeds out there. There was a lot of testing on Alpha, but now that its in the wild it will be easier to test and correct these things.<br />
SMALL UPDATES<br />
- Trout Farm is now part of the "Yes I'm Sure" <a href="supply.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Farm Supply</a> perk<br />
- IN BETA: If you try to retrieve items from your storehouse and the amount would put you over your max inventory, you'll be shown the max amount you can retrieve now instead of losing the items. </div>

REMINDER OF <a href="coc.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Code of Conduct</a><br />
- While Farm RPG is non-competitive, using any sort of script, bot, macro, etc to play the game in an automated fashion is strictly forbidden.<br />
- The reason for this is that automating the game causes a large amount of server requests and bandwidth usage that is not ideal as the game grows.<br />
SMALL UPDATES<br />
- Speed fixes, especially in Exploring<br />
- Custom chats will stick better and 4 will show now<br />
- Amount in Storehouse now shows on item details<br />

WHAT IS BETA?<br />

SMALL UPDATES<br />
- Pets now bring back items slightly differently. This is kind of hard to explain, but here goes: Before, a pet would bring back the items based on its level, but the rarity of the item was applied still, so you got mostly level 1 stuff, sometimes level 3, etc. Now the distribution is equal, meaning that depending on your pet level there is an equal chance of the pet bringing the items back each hour.<br />
- This change was applied to the wishing well as well.<br />
- In addition, the wishing well has more things now that can be tossed in, including most of the Halloween items. </div>

NEW FARM HANDS<br />
- Congrats to TempleofStones, Ffff, Jessica78, Milkbark, Hands<br />
- They are our newest Farm Hands (staff) and will help keep the peace in chat and continue to grow our excellent community<br />
<br />
SMALL FIXES<br />
- Made a number of database optimizations. I'm to the point where a query that takes 0.01 seconds is too slow<br />
- I found and fixed a number of tables that needed indexes and got a few queries that were 0.01 to be 0.0001<br />
<br />
SAY THANKS TO A STAFF MEMBER<br />
- While it's me working on the game code and development, I've got a great staff helping keep the game running smooth.<br />
- They do a ton of work here and don't get a lot of thanks. They manage the library, chat, help requests, discord and so much more. I couldn't do everything here without their support!<br />
- So, say thanks to the staff today. Send them a fish or something :) </div>

BUG FIXES<br />
- Fixed a bug with stamina refilling related to Energy Drink perk<br />
- Fixed a bug with 'dormant' farms. Basically, if you stop playing for a month your buildings will shut down. I did this to keep the database from filling up with data for players that don't play any longer. If you come back, your farm will no longer be dormant.<br />
SMALL FIXES<br />
- Added 'Check again' to the owner of a mailbox when it shows empty<br />
- The Wishing Well will start with the last item you tossed in<br />
- Added a search to the top of Item Mastery to let you quickly filter/find items </div>

BOOK CHANGES<br />
- First, the books can no longer be sold. This will keep future issues of getting a book and selling it and then needing it again from happening.<br />
- Second, if you had a book and sold it, you have it again now. There are some quests that use books and give them back, so you should be good.<br />
<br />
ITEM MASTERY DISPLAY<br />
- Item Mastery is now grouped by Tier and sorted by progress for each item<br />
- You will probably need to do a restart/refresh of the game for the colors to look right<br />
<br />
SMALL UPDATES<br />
- Beta Testers now get an extra toss daily at the Wishing Well<br />
- Also, a new <a href="supply.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Farm Supply</a> perk has been added to grant you an extra toss daily<br />
- So max tosses daily is 5 if you are Beta and have the perk. If you are not Beta, you can get the perk to go up to 4 daily. </div>

NEW FARM LAYOUT<br />
- Change is hard, but hang on!<br />
- My Farm has a new layout with a new way to plant seeds that is 2-3x faster and less clicks than before<br />
- Plant All has a new mode called 'Selected' that works with the Selected Seeds picker at the top<br />
- Everything fits nicer at the top vs having it under the Farm rows now<br />
- Another benefit of this change is you can always see what seeds you have at a glance<br />
- All of this was tested with feedback indicating its much improved over the former UI... but change is hard!<br />
- Feed Mill: This is NOT out for beta yet, but I goofed and a few folk bought it. When it's in Beta you'll hear about it.<br />
<br />
LOCKSMITH IN BETA<br />
- IN BETA: The Locksmith is available in Town now to Beta players<br />

ACTIVE HELP REQUESTS<br />

- You can even tap the items to go back to the Help Request and there's a button to turn off the active Help Request<br />
- This should make Help Request item tracking MUCH easier<br />
- You might need to do a full game restart/refresh<br />

STATUS ON NEW ZONES AND NEW BETA FEATURES<br />
- The new Fishing Zone and Exploration Zone are both getting closer to ready, but it will probably be next week before they go live. They will go to all players when they are ready.<br />
- The Wishing Well will be coming into Beta next, but it will probably be next week still. The Flour Mill will leave Beta at the same time.<br />

THE BOOK SITUATION<br />
- Books have been in the game for a while and have a greater purpose (see <a href="roadmap.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Roadmap</a>)<br />
- However, people ask nearly every day about selling them or keeping them and my answer has been keep them.<br />
- So people still sell them and we put out some Help Requests today to get them back<br />
- These requests only had good intentions but instead caused a lot of division and many many complaints, so they have been deactivated<br />
- Here's what I'm going to do instead: Keep or sell your books. It won't matter once the bookshelf comes out because if you have ever had the book it will be on the shelf and will be able to be used for the system (due sometime this month)<br />
- I am sorry for the trouble all of this has caused. </div>

Example: Corn is 3400 base and at 20% more becomes 4080<br />
Item Mastery is applied like this and then Perks, so combined is some serious Silver profits<br />

FISHING/EXPLORING LEVEL REQUIREMENTS CHANGING<br />
- Lake Minerva now requires Fishing Level 60 as well as the Lava Sphere<br />
- Ember Lagoon now requires Exploring Level 60 as well as the Inferno Sphere<br />
<br />
I'M MAD ABOUT THE PREVIOUS UPDATE, WHY DID LEVEL REQUIREMENTS INCREASE?<br />
- I expect some people to be annoyed or upset at moving the levels from 55 to 60<br />
- The reason is I have a new fishing zone and a new exploring zone in work that targets Level 70, so for the sake of consistency, I wanted to move the requirements around. Otherwise it's a long gap from 55 to 70.<br />
- More news on the new zones in a future update! </div>

NEW STAFF STRUCTURE<br />
- Farm RPG has grown so fast that we have reached the point that staff needs a new structure to be more efficient in moderating the game.<br />
- The new Staff structure is 2 levels: Farm Hands and Rangers<br />
- All existing Staff are now Rangers and can moderate the game just as they always have, but they have a cool new title to go with it.<br />
- New staff will be brought on as Farm Hands first and as needed could possibly be promoted to Ranger status<br />
- Farm Hands are still Staff, but they are limited to moderating chat, helping in the Library and a few other abilities.<br />
- We've also had a huge number of people apply to become Staff via the <a href="http://reddit.com/r/FarmRPG" class="external close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> thread and are working as quickly as possible to add some new people as the first Farm Hands in the game.<br />
SMALL UPDATES<br />
- Item quantities will show in red now if they are maxed out (meaning they have reached your Inventory Cap)<br />
- This applies to My Inventory and the Farmer's Market<br />
BOOK RENAMES<br />
- Some of the books in the system have been renamed to match my new plan for them in a future update.<br />
- Now that the books have been changed, I will be working in the near future on the book system!<br />
NEW ITEMS<br />
- At least 10 new items in the system today. Some you can get from exploring/fishing, etc and others from future Help Requests<br />
- Bugs: <a href="item.php?id=282" class="close-panel"><img src='/img/items/beetle.png' alt="Shiny Beetle" class='itemimgsm'></a><span style="display:none">Shiny Beetle</span> <a href="item.php?id=283" class="close-panel"><img src='/img/items/hbeetle.png' alt="Horned Beetle" class='itemimgsm'></a><span style="display:none">Horned Beetle</span> <a href="item.php?id=284" class="close-panel"><img src='/img/items/snail.png' alt="Snail" class='itemimgsm'></a><span style="display:none">Snail</span> <a href="item.php?id=287" class="close-panel"><img src='/img/items/giantcent.png' alt="Giant Centipede" class='itemimgsm'></a><span style="display:none">Giant Centipede</span> <a href="item.php?id=285" class="close-panel"><img src='/img/items/caterpillar.png' alt="Caterpillar" class='itemimgsm'></a><span style="display:none">Caterpillar</span> <a href="item.php?id=286" class="close-panel"><img src='/img/items/fireant.png' alt="Fire Ant" class='itemimgsm'></a><span style="display:none">Fire Ant</span> </div>

DAILY RESET ITEMS<br />
- I just ran that script again, so this time you should have gotten the stuff you were missing at midnight. The logs appear to show that it ran correctly this time.<br />
- This was caused by a setting I changed in prep for the new server that did not get changed back when I reverted to the old server.<br />
- It's very possible you got items twice, because for some people at midnight it ran, and for others it didn't. I ran the script again so that everybody would get their items for sure. </div>

UNSUCCESSFUL MIGRATION<br />
I tried to move us over to the new server today, and it looked like it was going to be ok at first. However, after running at high load I noticed a lot of my jobs that run hourly were taking 20-30 minutes to complete on the new server under high load. They only take about a minute on the old server, so there's configuration issues to work out. I didn't want to leave the game in an unplayable state, so I rolled us back to the old server.<br />
Your game progress is where it was at as of 2pm server time today, so only about an hour and half where you couldn't do much. I tried to minimize that as much as possible. Sorry for the downtime at all! </div>

3 MONTHS OLD!<br />
- Farm RPG hit the 3 months mark since official launch yesterday (8/12)!<br />
- In 3 months, just about 40,000 people have tried the game. We are seeing thousands of players on a daily basis and hundreds signing up per day too. The growth has been pretty cool to watch!<br />
- The game has evolved a lot in 3 months and will continue to grow and evolve with some really cool systems coming in the next 3 months.<br />
- Some things to look forward to: Pets (next week), Pig Pen (soon after), Bookshelf system, Horse Stables, Mining and Cooking Skills! (all of this will probably take me another 3 months)<br />
- More good news! Due to growth, I've ordered another server to help. It's the nicest web server I've ever been able to get and I am thankful for my supporters on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/farmrpg" class="external close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patreon</a> for making it possible. </div>

STAMINA REFILL RATE INCREASED<br />
- By default stamina now refills by 4 points every other minute.<br />
- The Energy Drink Perk bumps this up to 8 points every other minute.<br />
- This is about a 400% increase in how quickly you can fill back up. I decided on this after a lot of play testing and the feeling was that it was way way too long to wait for my stamina to refill to max.<br />
- At 300 stamina max, it will take a little over an hour now (vs 3-4 hours). </div>

MY WORKSHOP UPDATES<br />
- You can mark items as "favorite" by hitting the heart by their name in the list<br />
- "favorite" craft items show at the top this way and are always visible, even if you don't have the required resources. If you don't it just says "missing res" by it.<br />
- This improves the crafting UI by keeping the page from jumping almost completely.<br />
- I also fixed a few things in the code that could have been slowing things down.<br />
YES I'M SURE PERK UPDATED<br />
- The "Yes I'm Sure" Perk in <a href="supply.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Farm Supply</a> has been updated.<br />
- It now also removes the confirmations for Fishing Nets and Lemonades.<br />
- If you already have it, there is nothing you need to do. The cost did not change. </div>

IOS IN-APP-PURCHASES<br />
- This has been highly requested for the last few months and I'm excited to announce that IAPs are live on iOS!<br />
- You must have Farm RPG 1.2 from the App Store -> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/farm-rpg/id1564601242" class="external close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a><br />
- Then from Home go to Buy Gold and the rest should be self-explanatory.<br />
- iPad Users -> for some reason I'm not detecting iPads correctly so it still takes you to Paypal. This will be fixed ASAP!<br />
Android IAPs will be added next, hopefully in late August! </div>

REMINDER OF OUR RULES<br />
- Botting / mouse macros / auto-clickers = BAD and not allowed<br />
- I have logs that can show me people using these things and it is in the <a href="coc.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Code of Conduct</a> that they are not allowed because of the server strain it causes.<br />
- If you are caught, I will ban the account. No questions asked. It is not fair to the rest of the players to have a slower game because you want to bot it.<br />
- Thank you for understanding.<br />
SMALL CHANGES<br />
- When you buy from the Country Store, the OK popup now has a 'Go to Farm' option.<br />
- Increase Max Stamina has been pushed a bit further down from the rest of the Explore options. </div>

SMALL UPDATES<br />
- Plant All is MUCH faster now after finding the root cause of the lag (pun intended maybe)<br />
- Fixed another lag issue related to item count checks<br />
FIRST THE BAD NEWS / SAWMILL CHANGES (WOOD IN BETA)<br />
- Sawmill increased to 1 million Silver (from 750k)<br />
- Cost to increase board generation is now double from what it was.<br />
- Nobody likes a price hike, but the Sawmill has been a bit OP from the start<br />
- BETA ONLY: Sawmill can generate Wood now so it has another benefit!<br />
- BETA ONLY: Only our Beta players can increase Wood Generation for a few days to make sure all is good<br />
<br />
PLANT ALL SETTINGS (IN BETA)<br />
- BETA ONLY: You can change how 'Plant All' works now between Slowest, Fastest and Random<br />
- BETA ONLY: Go to My Farm > Farm Settings to change the setting and give it a try!<br />
- BETA ONLY: Default option is 'Slowest' which means it will focus on slower crops first<br />
WHY BETA FIRST?<br />
- Beta players support the game development via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/farmrpg" class="external close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patreon</a><br />
- This allows me to roll out changes and features to a smaller set of players first to make sure all is ok before thousands of people use a new feature. Sometimes things still go wrong, but Beta players help catch bugs before the general population.<br />
- Features in Beta usually go to all players within 7-10 days<br />

CODE OF CONDUCT UPDATE<br />
- Had to add a line about multiple accounts because there was confusion on if this is allowed or not.<br />
- They are NOT allowed because of the extra bloat that would be added to the database if thousands of players all had 2-3+ alt accounts. I'm trying to keep the game as lean / fast as possible, especially with the rapid growth we are seeing.<br />
- Thank you for understanding.<br />
MY FRIENDS [IN BETA]<br />
-There's a new Friends system up for Beta players (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/farmrpg" class="external close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patreon</a>). It's pretty straight forward, just visit a profile and hit the "+Friend" button at the top. "My Friends" is in the side menu.<br />
-From "My Friends" list you can quickly see if a friend is online, get to their profile (tap their name) or hit Messages / Mailbox.<br />
-It takes into account if the friend is showing their online status or not, and if they have blocked you you can't add them as a friend, etc.<br />
<br />
OTHER CHANGES<br />
- Some rare items have been removed from Item Mastery (Wine/Grape Juice for example)<br />
- Sending items via mailboxes now requires Farming level 10 </div>

<br />
AN UPDATE ON IN-APP-PURCHASES<br />
- Solid progress has been made on them for iOS.<br />
- However, there's some challenges in getting Tax info, etc, that Apple requires that may take as much as 30-60 days to complete. That means IAPs won't be added to the iOS app until at least late August / early September.<br />
- While all of that is in-work, I'll begin looking into setting up IAPs for Google/Android next.<br />
- In the mean-time, you can still support the game and buy gold on Desktop (PayPal or Patreon), and thank you to all that are doing that currently!<br />
<br />
SMALL CHANGES<br />

- As with each major update, the goal is to have it live to all players within 7-10 days.<br />

LAKE MINERVA FISH<br />

<br />
ENTER KEY SPAMMING<br />
- It's been known for a bit that you can explore faster with the Enter key (esp holding down) on PC. I need to set the record straight now that we have Stamina Effectiveness. Once it is out of Beta, if we find that you are enter key spamming and causing high server load, you'll get a warning, but if you continue we could possibly ban your account. It will be added to the <a href="coc.php" class="close-panel" style="color: crimson;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Code of Conduct</a> soon as well.<br />
- The main thing is that we understand you want to explore faster, but the speed of the game for all users is more important. Stamina Effectiveness per location allows you to explore way way faster and doesn't have the server load issues that enter key spamming has. Thank you for understanding. </div>

- When you hit 'Continue' it will tell you how much stamina you used and show you any items found.<br />
- Stamina and XP perks still apply (pay attention to your stamina / max display)<br />

NEW FARMHOUSE ADDITION<br />
- You can add a farmhouse now on your farm at Farming 30 and Exploring 30.<br />
- In the farmhouse you can rest once per day to increase your MAX stamina by 1.<br />
- There is a new Farm Supply Perk (Mattress Pad) that will make resting increase your max by 2.<br />
- There is a new achievement for building the Farmhouse worth 10 gold also<br />
<br />
GOLDEN CROPS<br />
- There are 3 new Golden Crops that start at farming level 53. They take the same amount of time as their non-golden version, but the xp/silver is 2x so on the road to level 99 they will help you greatly.<br />
<br />

BETTER MARKET SELLING OPTIONS<br />
- You can lock items at the Market now to keep them from being sold. The system remembers this too even if you get more items of that kind.<br />
- Included with this are options to lock/unlock all at once. Sell All Unlocked, Sell All Fish and Sell All Crops take the lock into account also.<br />
<br />
SMALL TWEAKS<br />
- Apples restore 15 stamina consistently now.<br />
- Apples, OJ and Lemonade all give Exploring XP now.<br />
- 'Bait Saver' Perks cost lowered a lot. If you have unlocked these when you go to perks it will work itself out, but you might have to go to perks, go somewhere else and back to perks.<br />
- Everybody's perk reset count has been reset to 0<br />
- The first perk reset is now free and then it goes up by 5 gold each time<br />
- Tweaks to fishing timing and maybe a fix for the caught fish end streak bug<br />
- Location Info now only shows the item if you have gotten the item. This is so that I can actually put secret items into the game without everybody figuring them all out. </div>

EXPLORE LEVEL 50 LOCATION<br />
- The Level 50 location has been added along with some new items to find and craft. <br />
- A lot of this is foundational stuff for the 2nd phase of the game. There are items you have probably seen that don't have any use yet, but they will in time.<br />
WHAT IS COMING NEXT<br />
At this point, most of the 'farm' part of Farm RPG is complete. There's a lot to do up to level 50 farming, fishing & exploring. Crafting still has a ways to go, but it is going to get better each week. However, there's a 2nd side of the game that I'm working on that really takes place after level 50 in your main skills. I'd love to share the details, but I'm not ready yet. Keep farming! </div>

VINEYARD AND WINE:<br />
- OK, new addition you can add to your farm: The Vineyard<br />
- Vineyards will produce grapes daily, but they are a significant investment.<br />
- Grapes can be used to make Wine via crafting (yes, this might become part of a cooking system eventually).<br />
- NOT COMPLETE, BUT PLANNED: Wine could be sold as-is, but I am working to make it so that wine will start to age and become more valuable the more days you keep each bottle. This will be completed in a future update.<br />
FISHING CHARTERS:<br />
- Another addition today is a new Fishing Charters option in Town<br />
- You can hire a Charter to go fish for you. The cost is 1 Gold per hour. You can check on the charter progress anytime. You will earn Fishing Skill XP as well.<br />
- This is an optional side of the game as you can always fish for yourself for no Gold cost.<br />
OTHER:<br />
- There are new items in the system today<br />
- Inventory caps rounded up 1 to the nearest 100 because it was bugging some people </div>

Gold & XP Changes:<br />
- Things that use Gold have had mild price hikes all over to be better balanced to the amount of Gold you earn from achievements (or supporting the game dev)<br />
- The amount of XP you get from Fishing and Exploring has been increased.<br />
- If you try to buy more items than you can carry, you are now told how many you could possibly buy.<br />
- Crafting now tells you if you have max inventory of the item<br />
- New Perk: Energy Drink -> extra stamina every other minute<br />
- Trout produced by your trout farm now gives fishing XP<br />
- Once a day, you can go pet each of your chickens to show them you love them. They will produce more eggs daily based on their level.<br />
Grape Juice:<br />
- This is a new item you can buy from the Flea Market for 25 Gold. It is expensive for a reason: it will complete your entire crop when you drink it<br />
- Now, before you scream PAY-TO-WIN, I have limited the use of Grape Juice to once per day.<br />
- The idea here is that more times than not, I have gone to bed wishing I could harvest my slow crops, so I am giving you a way to do that. The cost is high though for this convenience.<br />
- Since you can only do it once a day, I don't think it ends up being P2W. </div>
